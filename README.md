This document provides a guide for learning about the Linux Kernel, specifically focusing on kernel module programming. This README is based on insights from "The Linux Kernel Programming Guide"

## Learning Approach

The guide advocates for a hands-on learning experience, encouraging readers to experiment with the system and then delve into deeper understanding.Similar to learning a new programming language, it emphasizes the importance of starting with practical exercises like writing a simple "hello, world" program before diving into complex library code. This approach fosters an intuitive grasp of kernel module development.
